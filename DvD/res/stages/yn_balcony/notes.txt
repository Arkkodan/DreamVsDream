Notes for YN Balcony:

There are two floors: the floor where the fighters stand on and the front floor.

The TV layer may count as a background since it's behind the first floor layer. As seen on the Balcony Sample, the TV layers fit inside the largest space in the door's window.

Lets see how it goes. Enjoy! :)
