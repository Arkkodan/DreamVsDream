# Specific credits

These credits are meant to be fairly specific as a complement to general credits, such as in-game credits.
Anything not covered in the general credits or anything that provides more detail should go here.
This file should contain credits primarily concerning assets.
Since git automatically tracks the contributions of developers, developers should state an extremely concise synopsis of their contributions.
