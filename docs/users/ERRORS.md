# Errors with a distribution

If you have errors with a distribution, see if any of the information below applies to you.

## 32-bit vs. 64-bit programs

Make sure you are running the correct program corresponding to your operating system.
For example, if your operating system is 32-bit, you can only run the 32-bit program.
